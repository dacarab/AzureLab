    I'm looking to develop some Splunk apps that would monitor and alert on a domain,as well as #nix stuff.
    So Splunk on ubuntu is fine... but would need a domain controller to pull data from, and experiment with audit policy.
    A couple of member servers for the same.
    A few scrips that crete a bunch of users and groups.
    A few scripts that make changes on a periodic basis that I can report and alert against .
    And I guess a desktop that I can use from within the environment to do the do.
